# OpenCV 3 Projects for Photo Filtering [Video]
This is the code repository for [OpenCV 3 Projects for Photo Filtering [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-3-projects-photo-filtering-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787289055), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
OpenCV 3 is a native cross-platform C++ Library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. This video will help you tackle increasingly challenging computer vision problems that you may face in your job. We make use of OpenCV 3 to work around some interesting projects. 

You'll begin by deep diving into the basics of OpenCV 3, where you'll start a new project, and see how to load an image file and show it. Next, you'll find out how to handle keyboard events in our display window. In the next project, you'll jump into interactively adjusting image brightness. The Miniaturizing APP project will get you to add a miniaturizing tilt-shift effect and learn to blur images. In the final project, you'll learn to apply Instagram-like color ambiance filters to images. 

By the end of this course, you will learn to load process and store media files such as photos and videos, and will create photo and video processing apps such as Instagram and Pixlr. You will also discover how to quickly prototype UIs and allow real-time user interaction.
